                      Each order is assigned to a unique customer_id. 
                      This means that the same customer will get different ids for different orders. 
                      The purpose of having a customer_unique_id on the dataset is to allow you to identify customers that made repurchases at the store. 
                      Otherwise you would find that each order had a different customer associated with."
